1)Backstory

As an intern at a multinational mega-conglomerate a large portion of your day is making copies in a tiny room with no windows that smells of equal parts toner and broken dreams. The machine you are forced to deal with on a daily basis seems to have it out for you, literally. Everyone else gets their documents with no issue, and they don’t believe your requests to have it serviced, repaired or blessed by the clergy. Clearly this machine enjoys making you suffer.

One day after the infernal xerox has gotten you another chewing out from most of your 8 managers you decide to confront the grey behemoth. In a rage you slam your fists on the load tray. Bad idea. The device roars with all of its cooling fans and an thick bitter smoke envellops the copy room. Thats when you are inexplicably shrunk down and transported INSIDE the evil appliance.
